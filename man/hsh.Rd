\description{
A testing data set, a list of poly, line, points. The relationships
between the objects cover many interesting cases. There are multi-island
objects with holes and other objects that fall inside those holes. All paths
share vertices with a neighbour. There is topological intersection
along a diagonal line where two objects meet and are joined by
shared vertices that were inserted deliberately.

\code{hsh} is the holey home in sp format and \code{hsh_sf} in sf format.
